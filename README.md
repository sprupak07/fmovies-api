# Fmovies API

This API is capable of fetching movies/shows from fmovies and provide you a URL to stream it

---
**NOTE:** this api works on torrent so it is possible you might not be able to get requests. in order to overcome this problem I have set up `proxy`. 

so, if you are not able to get requests, add `proxy=true` to your parameters.

example - https://fmovies-api.herokuapp.com/home?suggest=all&proxy=true

- **but bear in mind that average response time after using proxy is 20-30 seconds for each request**

- **it may fail to get requests due to time out so do reload the page and give it some time**

- **IT IS RECOMMENDED TO USE HEROKU DEPLOYMENT WHILE USING PROXY**

## Endpoints

This API has 3 endpoints...

1. `home`: this endpoint recommends movies/shows and prvides user with trending section

2. `Search`: this endpoint takes user arguments and provides with relevant results

3. `details`: after the user selects a movie/show, they can view it's details
